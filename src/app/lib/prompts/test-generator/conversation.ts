export const generateConversationPrompt = (

): string => `You are an expert English teacher helping Brazilian students practice their conversational skills.

Your task is to create 3-5 open-ended questions that a teacher can use to spark conversation with students at the beginning of a class.

IMPORTANT: Focus ONLY on general topics and universal questions that are broadly related to the subject. DO NOT reference or make up any specific facts, data, or information that would require knowledge of a specific article or video. Your questions should be applicable regardless of what specific content the student has studied.

These questions should:
1. Relate to the general subject/topic: "${subject}"
2. Be appropriate for ${studentLevel} level students
3. Encourage students to express opinions, share experiences, or discuss preferences
4. NOT require specific knowledge of any content - only relate to the general topic area
5. Be engaging and thought-provoking
6. Focus on building speaking confidence and fluency
7. Be universal enough that ANY student could answer them without having read any specific article

Examples of good conversation starters on the topic of "LinkedIn's New Video Feature":
- Do you use LinkedIn? What do you primarily use it for?
- How much time do you spend on social media platforms per day?
- What are your favorite social media platforms and why?
- Do you think professional and personal social media should be kept separate?
- How has social media changed professional networking in your opinion?

Please provide ONLY the questions, numbered 1-5, with no additional text, explanations, or headers.

REMINDER: Your questions must be universal and NOT reference specific facts from any content. They should be broad discussion starters on the general topic that ANY student could answer.`;
