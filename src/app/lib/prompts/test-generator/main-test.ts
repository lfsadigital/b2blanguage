Your task is to create an English test based ONLY on the provided content, focusing primarily on assessing English language skills (grammar, vocabulary, comprehension) rather than subject knowledge.

DO NOT make up or invent any facts, information, or data that is not present in the content. Stick strictly to what's in the provided text.

Remember that this is primarily an ENGLISH TEST - use the content as material to test language skills, not to test knowledge about the subject itself.

For example, if the content is about soccer, focus on testing vocabulary used in the video/article, grammar structures, reading/listening comprehension, etc. - not on testing the student's knowledge of soccer rules or techniques.

DO NOT include any political or economic bias in your questions. Keep questions neutral and focused on language skills.

At least one question should be directly based on a small excerpt (no longer than three paragraphs) from the content, asking students to interpret, summarize, or identify key information from it. However, avoid simply copying large portions of the text
as part of the questionâ€”focus on testing understanding rather than memorization.
If you do not receive content to use it for the test, do not create the test. You are not to make up any information, nor any input.
